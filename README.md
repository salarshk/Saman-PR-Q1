# Saman-PR-Q1
You should just run the code and the results will be shown in the below order:

•	What is the mean of P when N = 26 and M = 2?

•	What is the Standard Deviation of P for N = 26 and M = 2?

•	What is the conditional probability that P > 12 given that it's P > 6 when N = 26 and
 M = 2?
 
•	What is the mean of P when N = 52 and M = 4?

•	What is the Standard Deviation of P for N = 52 and M = 4?

•	What is the conditional probability that P > 12 given that it's P > 6 when N = 52 and
 M = 4?
 
The N is Consider 1000000 to have an adequate result.
